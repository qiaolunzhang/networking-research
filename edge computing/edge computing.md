# difference between edge computing and fog computing

## Edge computing and Fog computing
Edge computing—also known as just “edge”—brings processing close to the data source, and it does not need to be sent to a remote cloud or other centralized systems for processing. By eliminating the distance and time it takes to send data to centralized sources, we can improve the speed and performance of data transport, as well as devices and applications on the edge.

Fog computing is a standard that defines how edge computing should work, and it facilitates the operation of compute storage and networking services between end devices and cloud computing data centers. Additionally, many use fog as a jumping-off point for edge computing.

## fog computing and mobile computing
Cloud Computing <-----> Fog Computing <--------> Mobile Computing (Mobile devices)

Cloud computing provides computation, communication, and storage resources installed in large Data Centers (DC). These DCs are typically very expensive, very large and a given company might own 10s of them around the world. 
For delay sensitive applications, and applications that require data aggregation, fog and mobile computing might provide "better" services. Fog computing resources are installed within smaller data centers (micro data centers as opposed to the much larger DCs that the cloud offers). Sometimes, a mobile cloud can be formed by the mobile devices themselves. In this can, you have "mist" computing or mobile computing in general. 
So the distinction between cloud, fog and mobile edge computing lies in the "distance" from the mobile clients/users.
